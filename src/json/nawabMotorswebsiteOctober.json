The Q50 is a solid value option in a competitive segment.&nbsp;The Q50 received some exterior and interior updates for 2018, with tweaks to the grille, headlights, and taillights. The Q50’s optional shift paddles are now mounted on the steering wheel instead of the steering column, and there’s new stitching on the dashboard, presumably intended to lend the Q50 a more premium feel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Coupled to an 8-speed automatic, paired with full-time four-wheel drive, and damped by an impressively tuned air suspension, the Range Rover can explore further than its drivers may dare to, whether that’s down a lightly marked trail or deep into a twisted canyon run. The Range Rover in four-seat spec has 20-way adjustable seats, refrigerated console coolers, perforated leather upholstery, extra-strength leg room, and more than 75 cubic feet of space for the inevitable custom-crafted luggage.&nbsp;The Range Rover’s technically complex air suspension adjusts constantly for height and firmness, defaulting to a slightly plush feel even on taut sporty versions that wear short-sidewall tires.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Chief among the changes is the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8, which is upgraded to make 550 horsepower and 502 lb-ft of torque. The extra 40 hp and 41 lb-ft are nice, but the exhaust fitted along with it is what makes everything come alive, particularly after you press the \"make it loud\" button on the center console.</p>\n<p data-c=\"paragraph\">To help manage the extra heat generated by the powertrain, the SVR is fitted with larger intakes in the front bumper, the only significant cosmetic change made; additional cooling for the six-piston Brembo front brakes that clamp down on 15.0-inch rotors is added as well. In fact, you have to look closely to see this is a special Rover. SVR badges are limited to one in the grille and one on the tailgate; the only other visual clues that there's a steroidal engine under the hood are the rear spoiler, quad exhaust tips, and rear diffuser.</p>\n<p data-c=\"paragraph\">The inside of the SVR looks and feels special, the carbon-fiber-trimmed, red-and-black two-tone interior makes for a sporty and youthful cabin fitting of a Range Rover custom ordered by a pro athlete. Front seats offer sporty levels of bolstering and will keep your torso in its appointed place should you decide to hit the canyons.&nbsp;</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The 2020 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a high-end, ultra-luxury SUV with serious off-road capability and more than a small dose of civility inside. That depends on your definition of good-looking. Favor the quiet, introverted look? Keep shopping. The boxy G-Wagon drips with personality outside and has a lavish interior that almost feels like it belongs in a Mercedes sedan. Quick with the&nbsp; 577-hp version in the AMG G63. Either way, a 9-speed automatic gearbox handles that power, and massive brakes&nbsp; bring things to a stop. A trio of drive modes—Comfort, Sport, and Sport+—wake up the gearbox. Grand and spacious, the G-Wagon has a lovely interior for passengers and cargo alike.&nbsp; The G-Class is a tank, though it hasn’t been crashed in the name of science yet. The G-Wagon is loaded with features for any terrain, as it should be for these prices.</p>\n<p>The Key Features includes:</p>\n<p>-Attractive Red Leather interior</p>\n<p>-Digital Cluster&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Ambient Lighting&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Rear view</p>\n<p>-Navigation</p>\n<p>-Sunroof</p>\n<p>-Burmester Audio</p>\n<p>-Heated Seats With Memory Package</p>\n<p>-16-Way Power Adjustable Heated Leather Seats</p>\n<p>-Leather Wrapped heated Multi-Functional Steering Wheel</p>\n<p>-LED Daytime Running Lights</p>\n<p>-Blind spots</p>\n<p>-Rear View Camera&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Lane Assist&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Vehicle Stability Management System</p>\n<p>-Tilt/Telescopic Steering Wheel&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Attractive AMG Alloys and much more!!!</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Some of that credibility is thanks to the growling 455-hp V-8 under the hood, which pairs with an excellent manual or automatic transmission. The other part belongs to its fantastic chassis that provides phenomenal ride and handling abilities. Along with its poster-worthy exterior design and legitimately affordable price, the Corvette has again&nbsp;won one of our 10Best Cars awards for 2019, meaning we think it's one of the best cars you can buy.&nbsp;Eight growling cylinders and 455 restless ponies mean the Corvette is intoxicatingly fun to drive. The V-8's pervasive howl is enough to convince eager drivers that every stop sign is a set of drag-strip Christmas-tree lights.

The latter include two turbocharged engines, a standard 255-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder and an optional 382-hp 3.0-liter inline-six. Both feed the rear wheels via a snappy eight-speed automatic transmission. The Toyota's cabin is snug and surprisingly premium, largely because it pulls from the BMW parts bin. The 2022 Supra also packs plenty of infotainment features and safety tech, too.</p>\n<p>Supra models come with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. At the test track,&nbsp; 2020 Supra 3.0 laid down some seriously impressive acceleration numbers: hitting 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and 100 mph in 9.5 ticks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The driver-focused cockpit is tight, and although the double-bubble roof provides some additional headroom, the tallest drivers will feel pinched. Cargo space is similarly cramped, but the cargo area (accessed via a hatchback) is roomy enough for a couple of carry-on suitcases or about a week's worth of groceries for two. In our testing, we managed to fit four carry-on suitcases behind the rear seats. Much of the Toyota's interior is shared with the Z4, so those familiar with BMW switchgear and infotainment controls will feel right at home.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The GT offers all the features from the models before it, plus performance features like engine oil cooler, hood vents for extra engine cooling, performance brake system, and Alloys and also comes standard with the V8 engine.</p>\n<p>The 2020 model year was the fastest and best-handling GT yet. In a wickedly deep-throated 5.0L rumble. It also pulls 0.98 lateral gs thanks in part to its fully independent suspension. The system has nearly 10x better anti-lift properties than the one it replaced, providing significantly better pitch control for aggressive starts and stops. As Motor Trend said, “… Mustang GT is the whole package, with an exhaust that’s muscular when exercised, a controlled ride, and an interior you don’t have to make excuses for. Long highway runs. High-speed passing. Advanced driver-assist technologies like adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with brake support can help you excel during these and other real-world challenges.

The GT offers all the features from the models before it, plus performance features like engine oil cooler, hood vents for extra engine cooling, performance brake system, and Alloys and also comes standard with the V8 engine.</p>\n<p>The 2021 model year was the fastest and best-handling GT yet. In a wickedly deep-throated 5.0L rumble. It also pulls 0.98 lateral gs thanks in part to its fully independent suspension. The system has nearly 10x better anti-lift properties than the one it replaced, providing significantly better pitch control for aggressive starts and stops. As Motor Trend said, “… Mustang GT is the whole package, with an exhaust that’s muscular when exercised, a controlled ride, and an interior you don’t have to make excuses for. Long highway runs. High-speed passing. Advanced driver-assist technologies like adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with brake support can help you excel during these and other real-world challenges.

The 2017 Mercedes-AMG C43 replaces last year’s Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG sedan. The C43’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is a gem. Powerful and torque-rich, the 362-hp engine pairs with a new nine-speed automatic transmission that swaps cogs with both speed and precision. Thanks to a smooth and predictable powerband and a bountiful 384 pound-feet of torque, the boosted six has deep wells of power and never feels overwhelmed or overworked when you call upon it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The C43’s interior is finely detailed and crafted of rich materials that meet the expectations set by the model’s lofty price. The cabin features a contemporary dashboard design with a flowing center stack that hides a deep storage well with a pair of cupholders. Largely devoid of buttons, the C43’s center stack is anchored by a row of expensive-looking knurled rocker switches for operating the standard dual-zone automatic climate control.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The GT offers all the features from the models before it, plus performance features like engine oil cooler, hood vents for extra engine cooling, performance brake system, and Alloys and also comes standard with the V8 engine.</p>\n<p>The 2019 model year was the fastest and best-handling GT yet. In a wickedly deep-throated 5.0L rumble. It also pulls 0.98 lateral gs thanks in part to its fully independent suspension. The system has nearly 10x better anti-lift properties than the one it replaced, providing significantly better pitch control for aggressive starts and stops. As Motor Trend said, “… Mustang GT is the whole package, with an exhaust that’s muscular when exercised, a controlled ride, and an interior you don’t have to make excuses for. Long highway runs. High-speed passing. Advanced driver-assist technologies like adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with brake support can help you excel during these and other real-world challenges.

Even though the basic engine layout has not changed, every detail has been optimized, honed and refined. Extremely sporty.&nbsp; The 911 Turbo S, delivers 640 hp. The sprint performances are excellent. The 911 Turbo S reaches 0-100 km/h in 2.7 seconds and reaches 200 km/h in 8.9 seconds. Top track speed: 330 km/h in the 911 Turbo S.</p>\n<p>Designed to reduce fuel consumption during everyday trips and achieve superlative performance on sporty drives: the active air intake flaps in the front air intakes. The flaps close automatically while the car is in motion, thereby reducing drag. On demand or in Sport, Sport Plus or PSM Sport mode, the flaps open, helping to provide optimum engine cooling. This means that cooling air is supplied only to the extent that it is actually needed. That’s efficiency. Of the intelligent kind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 14-way fully electric Sport Seats are not only comfortable, but also provide good lateral support. Seat height and backrest adjustment can be adjusted electrically, as can the fore/aft position, the lumbar support and the seat squab angle and depth.&nbsp;The standard BOSE Surround Sound System is optimally tuned to the specific interior acoustics of the 911 Turbo models. The audio system features 12 loudspeakers and amplifier channels including a patented, 100-watt subwoofer integral to the vehicle body shell.&nbsp;The interior consistently lives up to the promise made by the exterior. Even a first glance inside the vehicle reveals one of the greatest optical and digital enhancements of all generations. Uncompromising sporty performance. Combined with high comfort and exclusive feel.

But then Dodge offered the Hellcat Redeye Widebody that comes with 90 extra horsepower compared to regular Hellcat. Redeye comes with the Widebody look that adds Widebody Fender Flares, and also Widebody Competition Suspension for better track performance. With the Widebody look the car looks even better and more aggressive.</p>\n<p>This Redeye Comes in a Sleek Exterior design follows patterns from the classic original Challenger, launched back in 1971. Challenger has always been known as the largest, most blocky-looking American muscle car, intensifying its road presence. Revived for 2008, the modern version is more of a touring coupe than a raucous plaything: vigorous but comfortable, delivering a surprisingly supple ride.&nbsp;Not only the car deliver impressive performance, it has plenty of luxury features that make this sports car a comfortable cruiser too. Bluetooth with U-Connect will give you access to Navigation and all the features of the car.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

A traditional manual transmission isn't offered. Ferrari estimates that the 458 Italia will go from zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds.&nbsp;Optional features include forged aluminum alloy wheels, 19-inch run-flat tires, adaptive headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, cruise control, power seats, four different seat design choices, four-point race belts, faux suede upholstery and/or carpet, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, auto-dimming exterior mirrors, a navigation system, an iPod interface, satellite radio and a premium sound system. There are also innumerable customization options involving exterior paints and interior color schemes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2010 Italia's V8 is a legend in the making, with brutal acceleration bettered by only a scant few cars on the road. The powertrain has been blessed with a mechanical whine that is at first gruff and then intoxicatingly vibrant as the engine revs fly toward 9,000 rpm. We'll always lament the absence of a traditional manual transmission, but the dual-clutch automated manual whips through its seven gears with a quickness and smoothness&nbsp;</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The metalic silver trim pieces on the dash and doors will also remind you that this is the Turbo&nbsp; model. The Exterior is also enhanced with 20-inch 911 Turbo Wheels. Porsche also fits the Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) as a standard option on the Turbo&nbsp; model.<br><br>You'll love the driving experience. Porsche's AWD Model with a rear engine layout makes this an absolute beast yet refined with every steering wheel movement. With a 3.8L Flat 6 (Boxer Motor) Twin-Turbocharged engine making 580 HP mated to the quick shifting PDK transmission is an incredible combination! That power with the AWD System will make sure that you will be in control of the car. The PDK and AWD as well as the 580HP engine will accelerate this car to 60mph in just 2.8 Seconds. The car also comes standard with Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) active roll stabilization system for the best cornering performance. Porsche claims its PDCC technology enhances cornering performance by keeping the tires in their optimal position at all times, while minimizing body roll.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

All that throbbing energy is routed through a nine-speed automatic and the AMG-tuned 4Matic all-wheel-drive system, which enables this Mercedes to bolt to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. The quarter-mile is an 11.1-second 125-mph blur.&nbsp;AMG&nbsp;claims a top speed of 195 mph.&nbsp;That luxury emanates from both the way the car drives and how it's equipped. The interior is modern and gorgeous, bordering on decadent.&nbsp;This AMG has&nbsp;&nbsp;$5710 worth of black nappa leather, microsuede, and carbon fiber. The $500 yellow seatbelts and the perfectly sewn contrast stitching matched the body color. Optional highly adjustable sport seats provided additional support for hard cornering.</p>\n<p>The front of the cabin is dominated by Mercedes's digital instrument cluster/info­tainment screen, which is actually two 12.3-inch displays under one piece of glass. The graphics are tasteful and crisply rendered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some other key features are :</p>\n<p>-Heads up display</p>\n<p>- Ambient lights</p>\n<p>-Sunroof</p>\n<p>-Luxury&nbsp; interior with carbon fibre</p>\n<p>-vented&nbsp; seats with memory package</p>\n<p>-Hill start assist</p>\n<p>-Different driving modes</p>\n<p>- Premium sound system</p>\n<p>-Power adjustable multi functional heated steering wheel</p>\n<p>-Backup camera with sensors</p>\n<p>-HID lights with high beam assist</p>\n<p>- Soft touch Steering wheel controls</p>\n<p>-Navigation and much more advanced features!</p>\n<p>At Nawab Motors we are committed to provide our customers with the best quality vehicles that are fully inspected, warranty backed and priced to sell fast because at the end of the day everyone deserves the right to drive a quality, reliable vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

This fire-breathing&nbsp;Jeep product&nbsp;features aggressive bodywork, a sport-tuned suspension, and beefed-up brakes. A 475-hp V-8 pairs with a paddle-shifted eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, and launch control optimizes all relevant systems for maximum acceleration.&nbsp;The 707-hp Trackhawk version&nbsp;(reviewed separately) ups the ridiculousness even more. Still, both can tow up to 7200 pounds and haul the whole family without complaint. The way the GC SRT can hustle around a track, it's easy to forget it's an SUV.&nbsp;The Grand Cherokee SRT first won our hearts with its thunderous Hemi V-8 and impressive performance. Although its naturally aspirated 6.4-liter V-8 is mild compared with the Trackhawk's 707-hp supercharged V-8, it still has 475 horses and 470 lb-ft of torque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Key Features includes:</p>\n<p>-Launch Control</p>\n<p>- Travel Link&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Wifi Hotspot</p>\n<p>-Attractive Leather interior</p>\n<p>-Rear view camera</p>\n<p>-Navigation</p>\n<p>-Heated &amp; Vented Seats With Memory Package</p>\n<p>-16-Way Power Adjustable Heated Leather Seats</p>\n<p>-Leather Wrapped Multi-Functional Steering Wheel</p>\n<p>-LED Daytime Running Lights</p>\n<p>-Blind spots</p>\n<p>-Rear View Camera&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Vehicle Stability Management System</p>\n<p>-Tilt/Telescopic Steering Wheel&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Attractive AMG Alloys and much more!!!</p>\n<p>At Nawab Motors we are committed to provide our customers with the best quality vehicles that are fully inspected, warranty backed and priced to sell fast because at the end of the day everyone deserves the right to drive a quality, reliable vehicle.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

This fire-breathing&nbsp;Jeep product&nbsp;features aggressive bodywork, a sport-tuned suspension, and beefed-up brakes. A 475-hp V-8 pairs with a paddle-shifted eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, and launch control optimizes all relevant systems for maximum acceleration.&nbsp;The 707-hp Trackhawk version&nbsp;(reviewed separately) ups the ridiculousness even more. Still, both can tow up to 7200 pounds and haul the whole family without complaint. The way the GC SRT can hustle around a track, it's easy to forget it's an SUV.&nbsp;The Grand Cherokee SRT first won our hearts with its thunderous Hemi V-8 and impressive performance. Although its naturally aspirated 6.4-liter V-8 is mild compared with the Trackhawk's 707-hp supercharged V-8, it still has 475 horses and 470 lb-ft of torque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Key Features includes:</p>\n<p>-Launch Control</p>\n<p>- Travel Link&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Wifi Hotspot</p>\n<p>-Attractive Leather interior</p>\n<p>-Rear view camera</p>\n<p>-Navigation</p>\n<p>-Heated &amp; Vented Seats With Memory Package</p>\n<p>-16-Way Power Adjustable Heated Leather Seats</p>\n<p>-Leather Wrapped Multi-Functional Steering Wheel</p>\n<p>-LED Daytime Running Lights</p>\n<p>-Blind spots</p>\n<p>-Rear View Camera&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Vehicle Stability Management System</p>\n<p>-Tilt/Telescopic Steering Wheel&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Attractive AMG Alloys and much more!!!</p>\n<p>At Nawab Motors we are committed to provide our customers with the best quality vehicles that are fully inspected, warranty backed and priced to sell fast because at the end of the day everyone deserves the right to drive a quality, reliable vehicle.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class=\"space-5\"></div><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.
