Its suspension is tuned tautly enough to handle cornering at race-track speeds without being bone-jarring on the street, and it has brakes to match.

The Q50 is a solid value option in a competitive segment.&nbsp;The Q50 received some exterior and interior updates for 2018, with tweaks to the grille, headlights, and taillights. The Q50’s optional shift paddles are now mounted on the steering wheel instead of the steering column, and there’s new stitching on the dashboard, presumably intended to lend the Q50 a more premium feel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Coupled to an 8-speed automatic, paired with full-time four-wheel drive, and damped by an impressively tuned air suspension, the Range Rover can explore further than its drivers may dare to, whether that’s down a lightly marked trail or deep into a twisted canyon run. The Range Rover in four-seat spec has 20-way adjustable seats, refrigerated console coolers, perforated leather upholstery, extra-strength leg room, and more than 75 cubic feet of space for the inevitable custom-crafted luggage.&nbsp;The Range Rover’s technically complex air suspension adjusts constantly for height and firmness, defaulting to a slightly plush feel even on taut sporty versions that wear short-sidewall tires.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Chief among the changes is the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8, which is upgraded to make 550 horsepower and 502 lb-ft of torque. The extra 40 hp and 41 lb-ft are nice, but the exhaust fitted along with it is what makes everything come alive, particularly after you press the \"make it loud\" button on the center console.</p>\n<p data-c=\"paragraph\">To help manage the extra heat generated by the powertrain, the SVR is fitted with larger intakes in the front bumper, the only significant cosmetic change made; additional cooling for the six-piston Brembo front brakes that clamp down on 15.0-inch rotors is added as well. In fact, you have to look closely to see this is a special Rover. SVR badges are limited to one in the grille and one on the tailgate; the only other visual clues that there's a steroidal engine under the hood are the rear spoiler, quad exhaust tips, and rear diffuser.</p>\n<p data-c=\"paragraph\">The inside of the SVR looks and feels special, the carbon-fiber-trimmed, red-and-black two-tone interior makes for a sporty and youthful cabin fitting of a Range Rover custom ordered by a pro athlete. Front seats offer sporty levels of bolstering and will keep your torso in its appointed place should you decide to hit the canyons.&nbsp;</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The 2020 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a high-end, ultra-luxury SUV with serious off-road capability and more than a small dose of civility inside. That depends on your definition of good-looking. Favor the quiet, introverted look? Keep shopping. The boxy G-Wagon drips with personality outside and has a lavish interior that almost feels like it belongs in a Mercedes sedan. Quick with the&nbsp; 577-hp version in the AMG G63. Either way, a 9-speed automatic gearbox handles that power, and massive brakes&nbsp; bring things to a stop. A trio of drive modes—Comfort, Sport, and Sport+—wake up the gearbox. Grand and spacious, the G-Wagon has a lovely interior for passengers and cargo alike.&nbsp; The G-Class is a tank, though it hasn’t been crashed in the name of science yet. The G-Wagon is loaded with features for any terrain, as it should be for these prices.</p>\n<p>The Key Features includes:</p>\n<p>-Attractive Red Leather interior</p>\n<p>-Digital Cluster&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Ambient Lighting&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Rear view</p>\n<p>-Navigation</p>\n<p>-Sunroof</p>\n<p>-Burmester Audio</p>\n<p>-Heated Seats With Memory Package</p>\n<p>-16-Way Power Adjustable Heated Leather Seats</p>\n<p>-Leather Wrapped heated Multi-Functional Steering Wheel</p>\n<p>-LED Daytime Running Lights</p>\n<p>-Blind spots</p>\n<p>-Rear View Camera&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Lane Assist&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Vehicle Stability Management System</p>\n<p>-Tilt/Telescopic Steering Wheel&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Attractive AMG Alloys and much more!!!</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Its powertrains are both efficient and eager, and the interior is as spacious as it is technologically advanced. Despite being a handling sweetheart, the 2018 A4's ride doesn't beat up passengers on bumpy roads. Pitch it into a corner at speed and the suspension quickly settles in and holds its line to see you out the other side feeling like a pro. Inside, Audi offers a trick digital gauge display, and advanced driver-assistance features that make it a useful device for commuting as well as road-trip duty. Its appearance may be unassuming but make no mistake: in the entry-lux class, the A4 is a superhero.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The A4's infotainment system consists of a 7.0-inch center screen that's controlled by a rotary knob on the center console. An 8.3-inch screen is optional, as is the aforementioned Virtual Cockpit that includes a 12.3-inch gauge cluster display. Features are generous and include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, two USB ports, and voice command.

Some of that credibility is thanks to the growling 455-hp V-8 under the hood, which pairs with an excellent manual or automatic transmission. The other part belongs to its fantastic chassis that provides phenomenal ride and handling abilities. Along with its poster-worthy exterior design and legitimately affordable price, the Corvette has again&nbsp;won one of our 10Best Cars awards for 2019, meaning we think it's one of the best cars you can buy.&nbsp;Eight growling cylinders and 455 restless ponies mean the Corvette is intoxicatingly fun to drive. The V-8's pervasive howl is enough to convince eager drivers that every stop sign is a set of drag-strip Christmas-tree lights. Things quiet down to a tolerable throb at highway speeds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Other premium features include:-</p>\n<p>-Attractive Leather Interior&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Sunroof</p>\n<p>-Bucket Seats</p>\n<p>-Heated Seats</p>\n<p>-Bose Premium Audio</p>\n<p>-Rear View Camera</p>\n<p>-Cruise Control</p>\n<p>-Drive Mode Selector</p>\n<p>-Multi-Functional Steering Wheel&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Apple Carplay</p>\n<p>-Android Auto</p>\n<p>-Proximity Key</p>\n<p>-Alloys &amp; Much More!</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Its comfortable front seats and straightforward layout are high points. The Camaro cradles front passengers with nicely bolstered seats; the available Recaro front buckets improve support for hard cornering without being too restrictive. The Camaro’s dashboard design is clean, and the driver has a gauge cluster with an available 8.0-inch configurable display. While the screen and analog gauges are easy to read, the large housing looks bulky.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other premium features include:-</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Attractive Interior&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Sunroof</p>\n<p>-Paddle Shift</p>\n<p>-Stylish Seats</p>\n<p>-Heated Seats</p>\n<p>-Premium Audio</p>\n<p>-Rear View Camera</p>\n<p>-Cruise Control</p>\n<p>-Multi-Functional Steering Wheel&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Apple Carplay</p>\n<p>-Android Auto</p>\n<p>-Proximity Key</p>\n<p>-Alloys &amp; Much More!</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Its powertrains are both efficient and eager, and the interior is as spacious as it is technologically advanced. Despite being a handling sweetheart, the 2018 A4's ride doesn't beat up passengers on bumpy roads. Pitch it into a corner at speed and the suspension quickly settles in and holds its line to see you out the other side feeling like a pro. Inside, Audi offers a trick digital gauge display, and advanced driver-assistance features that make it a useful device for commuting as well as road-trip duty. Its appearance may be unassuming but make no mistake: in the entry-lux class, the A4 is a superhero.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The A4's infotainment system consists of a 7.0-inch center screen that's controlled by a rotary knob on the center console. An 8.3-inch screen is optional, as is the aforementioned Virtual Cockpit that includes a 12.3-inch gauge cluster display. Features are generous and include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, two USB ports, and voice command. Navigation, SiriusXM satellite radio, and in-car Wi-Fi are included in various option packages, as is a more powerful Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system with 19 speakers.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The latter include two turbocharged engines, a standard 255-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder and an optional 382-hp 3.0-liter inline-six. Both feed the rear wheels via a snappy eight-speed automatic transmission. The Toyota's cabin is snug and surprisingly premium, largely because it pulls from the BMW parts bin. The 2022 Supra also packs plenty of infotainment features and safety tech, too.</p>\n<p>Supra models come with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. At the test track,&nbsp; 2020 Supra 3.0 laid down some seriously impressive acceleration numbers: hitting 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and 100 mph in 9.5 ticks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The driver-focused cockpit is tight, and although the double-bubble roof provides some additional headroom, the tallest drivers will feel pinched. Cargo space is similarly cramped, but the cargo area (accessed via a hatchback) is roomy enough for a couple of carry-on suitcases or about a week's worth of groceries for two. In our testing, we managed to fit four carry-on suitcases behind the rear seats. Much of the Toyota's interior is shared with the Z4, so those familiar with BMW switchgear and infotainment controls will feel right at home.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The GT offers all the features from the models before it, plus performance features like engine oil cooler, hood vents for extra engine cooling, performance brake system, and Alloys and also comes standard with the V8 engine.</p>\n<p>The 2020 model year was the fastest and best-handling GT yet. In a wickedly deep-throated 5.0L rumble. It also pulls 0.98 lateral gs thanks in part to its fully independent suspension. The system has nearly 10x better anti-lift properties than the one it replaced, providing significantly better pitch control for aggressive starts and stops. As Motor Trend said, “… Mustang GT is the whole package, with an exhaust that’s muscular when exercised, a controlled ride, and an interior you don’t have to make excuses for. Long highway runs. High-speed passing. Advanced driver-assist technologies like adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with brake support can help you excel during these and other real-world challenges.

The GT offers all the features from the models before it, plus performance features like engine oil cooler, hood vents for extra engine cooling, performance brake system, and Alloys and also comes standard with the V8 engine.</p>\n<p>The 2021 model year was the fastest and best-handling GT yet. In a wickedly deep-throated 5.0L rumble. It also pulls 0.98 lateral gs thanks in part to its fully independent suspension. The system has nearly 10x better anti-lift properties than the one it replaced, providing significantly better pitch control for aggressive starts and stops. As Motor Trend said, “… Mustang GT is the whole package, with an exhaust that’s muscular when exercised, a controlled ride, and an interior you don’t have to make excuses for. Long highway runs. High-speed passing. Advanced driver-assist technologies like adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with brake support can help you excel during these and other real-world challenges. Turn up the heat everywhere you go in a Mustang GT.</p>\n<p>It comes with -</p>\n<p>Navigation</p>\n<p>Premium Interior</p>\n<p>Alloys</p>\n<p>And many other premium features.......!</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The GT offers all the features from the models before it, plus performance features like engine oil cooler, hood vents for extra engine cooling, performance brake system, and Alloys and also comes standard with the V8 engine.</p>\n<p>The 2019 model year was the fastest and best-handling GT yet. In a wickedly deep-throated 5.0L rumble. It also pulls 0.98 lateral gs thanks in part to its fully independent suspension. The system has nearly 10x better anti-lift properties than the one it replaced, providing significantly better pitch control for aggressive starts and stops. As Motor Trend said, “… Mustang GT is the whole package, with an exhaust that’s muscular when exercised, a controlled ride, and an interior you don’t have to make excuses for. Long highway runs. High-speed passing. Advanced driver-assist technologies like adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with brake support can help you excel during these and other real-world challenges.

The 2017 Mercedes-AMG C43 replaces last year’s Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG sedan. The C43’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is a gem. Powerful and torque-rich, the 362-hp engine pairs with a new nine-speed automatic transmission that swaps cogs with both speed and precision. Thanks to a smooth and predictable powerband and a bountiful 384 pound-feet of torque, the boosted six has deep wells of power and never feels overwhelmed or overworked when you call upon it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The C43’s interior is finely detailed and crafted of rich materials that meet the expectations set by the model’s lofty price. The cabin features a contemporary dashboard design with a flowing center stack that hides a deep storage well with a pair of cupholders. Largely devoid of buttons, the C43’s center stack is anchored by a row of expensive-looking knurled rocker switches for operating the standard dual-zone automatic climate control.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The GT offers all the features from the models before it, plus performance features like engine oil cooler, hood vents for extra engine cooling, performance brake system, and Alloys and also comes standard with the V8 engine.</p>\n<p>The 2019 model year was the fastest and best-handling GT yet. In a wickedly deep-throated 5.0L rumble. It also pulls 0.98 lateral gs thanks in part to its fully independent suspension. The system has nearly 10x better anti-lift properties than the one it replaced, providing significantly better pitch control for aggressive starts and stops. As Motor Trend said, “… Mustang GT is the whole package, with an exhaust that’s muscular when exercised, a controlled ride, and an interior you don’t have to make excuses for. Long highway runs. High-speed passing. Advanced driver-assist technologies like adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with brake support can help you excel during these and other real-world challenges. Turn up the heat everywhere you go in a Mustang GT.</p>\n<p>It comes with -</p>\n<p>Navigation</p>\n<p>Leather Interior</p>\n<p>Digital Cluster</p>\n<p>Heated and Vented Power Seats</p>\n<p>Alloys</p>\n<p>And many other premium features.......!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Even though the basic engine layout has not changed, every detail has been optimized, honed and refined. Extremely sporty.&nbsp; The 911 Turbo S, delivers 640 hp. The sprint performances are excellent. The 911 Turbo S reaches 0-100 km/h in 2.7 seconds and reaches 200 km/h in 8.9 seconds. Top track speed: 330 km/h in the 911 Turbo S.</p>\n<p>Designed to reduce fuel consumption during everyday trips and achieve superlative performance on sporty drives: the active air intake flaps in the front air intakes. The flaps close automatically while the car is in motion, thereby reducing drag. On demand or in Sport, Sport Plus or PSM Sport mode, the flaps open, helping to provide optimum engine cooling. This means that cooling air is supplied only to the extent that it is actually needed. That’s efficiency. Of the intelligent kind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 14-way fully electric Sport Seats are not only comfortable, but also provide good lateral support. Seat height and backrest adjustment can be adjusted electrically, as can the fore/aft position, the lumbar support and the seat squab angle and depth.&nbsp;The standard BOSE Surround Sound System is optimally tuned to the specific interior acoustics of the 911 Turbo models. The audio system features 12 loudspeakers and amplifier channels including a patented, 100-watt subwoofer integral to the vehicle body shell.&nbsp;The interior consistently lives up to the promise made by the exterior. Even a first glance inside the vehicle reveals one of the greatest optical and digital enhancements of all generations. Uncompromising sporty performance.

The 5.2-liter naturally aspirated V10 mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission completes 0-60 mph in under 3.0 seconds and top speed of 202 mph. The engine's unfiltered acoustics dominate every moment in the Huracan, and gets even better with the roof pulled down. Acceleration off the mark is stupendously quick and throttle response is mightily impressive so that even overtaking at higher speeds sees the Lambo overcome without even breaking a sweat. The seven-speed transmission flicks through the gears just as eagerly as the engine reaches its 6500 rpm red-line, and using the tactile paddle shifters is pure driving indulgence.&nbsp;The Huracan Evo Spyder gets 3 driving modes to choose from in form of the Strada (street/city) mode, Sport and Corsa mode. With the Corsa mode being the official get go battle mode on the car, gear shifts lose their smoothness but are instantaneously quick. With the Exhaust note also getting louder as you work through the gears, the Evo’s powertrain delivers the necessary grunt it promises with its extravagant looks. Though an individual customized driving settings would have been much better, but driver’s won’t get any chances to complain with the existing features on offer.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

It is a stellar combination that can be tailored to suit. There are Sport, Comfort or Eco Pro modes along with the new favorite — Adaptive. As with the other modes, Adaptive alters the suspension’s damping, the engine, transmission and steering, but goes one further — it dips into the navigation system’s information and readies the car for the road yet to be driven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Simple hand gestures allows to turn the volume up and down by twirling an index finger just above the shifter. Pointing two fingers in its direction muted or brought the audio system back to life.

A traditional manual transmission isn't offered. Ferrari estimates that the 488 GTB will go from zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds.&nbsp;Optional features include premium alloy wheels, 19-inch run-flat tires, adaptive headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, cruise control, power seats, four different seat design choices, four-point race belts, faux suede upholstery and/or carpet, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, auto-dimming exterior mirrors, a navigation system, an iPod interface, satellite radio and a premium sound system. There are also innumerable customization options involving exterior paints and interior color schemes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2017 FERRARI 488 GTB V8 is a legend in the making, with brutal acceleration bettered by only a scant few cars on the road. The powertrain has been blessed with a mechanical whine that is at first gruff and then intoxicatingly vibrant as the engine revs fly toward 8000 rpm.</p>\n<p>Other Premium Upgrades include -&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Full Akrapovic Exhaust System&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Novitec Rosso Lowering Kit</p>\n<p>3. Full PPF</p>\n<p>4. Carbon Spoiler&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. Carbon Lip&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6.

Its powertrains are both efficient and eager, and the interior is as spacious as it is technologically advanced. Despite being a handling sweetheart, the 2018 A4's ride doesn't beat up passengers on bumpy roads. Pitch it into a corner at speed and the suspension quickly settles in and holds its line to see you out the other side feeling like a pro. Inside, Audi offers a trick digital gauge display, and advanced driver-assistance features that make it a useful device for commuting as well as road-trip duty. Its appearance may be unassuming but make no mistake: in the entry-lux class, the A4 is a superhero.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The A4's infotainment system consists of a 7.0-inch center screen that's controlled by a rotary knob on the center console. An 8.3-inch screen is optional, as is the aforementioned Virtual Cockpit that includes a 12.3-inch gauge cluster display. Features are generous and include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, two USB ports, and voice command. Navigation, SiriusXM satellite radio, and in-car Wi-Fi are included in various option packages, as is a more powerful Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system with 19 speakers.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The Q50 is a solid value option in a competitive segment.&nbsp;The Q50 received some exterior and interior updates for 2018, with tweaks to the grille, headlights, and taillights. The Q50’s optional shift paddles are now mounted on the steering wheel instead of the steering column, and there’s new stitching on the dashboard, presumably intended to lend the Q50 a more premium feel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

But then Dodge offered the Hellcat Redeye Widebody that comes with 90 extra horsepower compared to regular Hellcat. Redeye comes with the Widebody look that adds Widebody Fender Flares, and also Widebody Competition Suspension for better track performance. With the Widebody look the car looks even better and more aggressive.</p>\n<p>This Redeye Comes in a Sleek Exterior design follows patterns from the classic original Challenger, launched back in 1971. Challenger has always been known as the largest, most blocky-looking American muscle car, intensifying its road presence. Revived for 2008, the modern version is more of a touring coupe than a raucous plaything: vigorous but comfortable, delivering a surprisingly supple ride.&nbsp;Not only the car deliver impressive performance, it has plenty of luxury features that make this sports car a comfortable cruiser too. Bluetooth with U-Connect will give you access to Navigation and all the features of the car.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

Coupled to an 8-speed automatic, paired with full-time four-wheel drive, and damped by an impressively tuned air suspension, the Range Rover can explore further than its drivers may dare to, whether that’s down a lightly marked trail or deep into a twisted canyon run. The Range Rover in four-seat spec has 20-way adjustable seats, refrigerated console coolers, perforated leather upholstery, extra-strength leg room, and more than 75 cubic feet of space for the inevitable custom-crafted luggage.&nbsp;The Range Rover’s technically complex air suspension adjusts constantly for height and firmness, defaulting to a slightly plush feel even on taut sporty versions that wear short-sidewall tires.</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

A traditional manual transmission isn't offered. Ferrari estimates that the 458 Italia will go from zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds.&nbsp;Optional features include forged aluminum alloy wheels, 19-inch run-flat tires, adaptive headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, cruise control, power seats, four different seat design choices, four-point race belts, faux suede upholstery and/or carpet, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, auto-dimming exterior mirrors, a navigation system, an iPod interface, satellite radio and a premium sound system. There are also innumerable customization options involving exterior paints and interior color schemes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2010 Italia's V8 is a legend in the making, with brutal acceleration bettered by only a scant few cars on the road. The powertrain has been blessed with a mechanical whine that is at first gruff and then intoxicatingly vibrant as the engine revs fly toward 9,000 rpm. We'll always lament the absence of a traditional manual transmission, but the dual-clutch automated manual whips through its seven gears with a quickness and smoothness&nbsp;</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a high-end, ultra-luxury SUV with serious off-road capability and more than a small dose of civility inside. That depends on your definition of good-looking. Favor the quiet, introverted look? Keep shopping. The boxy G-Wagon drips with personality outside and has a lavish interior that almost feels like it belongs in a Mercedes sedan. Quick with the&nbsp; 577-hp version in the AMG G63. Either way, a 9-speed automatic gearbox handles that power, and massive brakes&nbsp; bring things to a stop. A trio of drive modes—Comfort, Sport, and Sport+—wake up the gearbox. Grand and spacious, the G-Wagon has a lovely interior for passengers and cargo alike.&nbsp; The G-Class is a tank, though it hasn’t been crashed in the name of science yet. The G-Wagon is loaded with features for any terrain, as it should be for these prices.</p>\n<p>The Key Features includes:</p>\n<p>-Attractive Red Leather interior</p>\n<p>-Digital Cluster&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Ambient Lighting&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Rear view</p>\n<p>-Navigation</p>\n<p>-Sunroof</p>\n<p>-Burmester Audio</p>\n<p>-Heated Seats With Memory Package</p>\n<p>-16-Way Power Adjustable Heated Leather Seats</p>\n<p>-Leather Wrapped heated Multi-Functional Steering Wheel</p>\n<p>-LED Daytime Running Lights</p>\n<p>-Blind spots</p>\n<p>-Rear View Camera&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Lane Assist&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Vehicle Stability Management System</p>\n<p>-Tilt/Telescopic Steering Wheel&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Attractive AMG Alloys and much more!!!</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

All that throbbing energy is routed through a nine-speed automatic and the AMG-tuned 4Matic all-wheel-drive system, which enables this Mercedes to bolt to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. The quarter-mile is an 11.1-second 125-mph blur.&nbsp;AMG&nbsp;claims a top speed of 195 mph.&nbsp;That luxury emanates from both the way the car drives and how it's equipped. The interior is modern and gorgeous, bordering on decadent.&nbsp;This AMG has&nbsp;&nbsp;$5710 worth of black nappa leather, microsuede, and carbon fiber. The $500 yellow seatbelts and the perfectly sewn contrast stitching matched the body color. Optional highly adjustable sport seats provided additional support for hard cornering.</p>\n<p>The front of the cabin is dominated by Mercedes's digital instrument cluster/info­tainment screen, which is actually two 12.3-inch displays under one piece of glass. The graphics are tasteful and crisply rendered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some other key features are :</p>\n<p>-Heads up display</p>\n<p>- Ambient lights</p>\n<p>-Sunroof</p>\n<p>-Luxury&nbsp; interior with carbon fibre</p>\n<p>-vented&nbsp; seats with memory package</p>\n<p>-Hill start assist</p>\n<p>-Different driving modes</p>\n<p>- Premium sound system</p>\n<p>-Power adjustable multi functional heated steering wheel</p>\n<p>-Backup camera with sensors</p>\n<p>-HID lights with high beam assist</p>\n<p>- Soft touch Steering wheel controls</p>\n<p>-Navigation and much more advanced features!</p>\n<p>At Nawab Motors we are committed to provide our customers with the best quality vehicles that are fully inspected, warranty backed and priced to sell fast because at the end of the day everyone deserves the right to drive a quality, reliable vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>                                        </div>\n                                        <br>\n                                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                                            <p>\n                                                </p><p>OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK.

All models of this dramatically styled coupe come with a 624-hp V-12 engine, rear-hinged doors, and the signature Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament.&nbsp;The Wraith's prodigious twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V-12 produces 624 horsepower and 605 pound-feet of torque and mates with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Exclusively a rear-driver, this Rolls-Royce delivers handling that's poised and controlled. Its steering is lightly weighted, and its air suspension is calibrated to prevent bumps and jolts from jostling the car's passengers. We estimate that the Wraith will&nbsp;sprint to 60 mph in about 4.3 seconds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This car lets you enjoy in a few more added creature comforts such as</p>\n<p>-Rear View Cam With Parking Sensors</p>\n<p>- White leather Interior</p>\n<p>-Dual Climate Control&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Dual Power Seats</p>\n<p>- Roof star lights</p>\n<p>-Attractive Alloys</p>\n<p>-Cruise Control</p>\n<p>-Blind Spots</p>\n<p>-Leather Wrapped Multi-functional Steering Wheel.</p>\n<p>-Push Button Start</p>\n<p>-Proximity Key and much more!!!</p>\n<p>Drive Away With this Beauty Today!!
